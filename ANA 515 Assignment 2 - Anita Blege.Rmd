The raw survey file is comma delimited and about 2.16mb in size. This is a one-time data set collated through a survey which was administered by two FiveThirtyEight reporters using Survey Monkey. The data contains the responses of 1,615 survey respondents on characteristics of masculinity and what they think it means to be a man. The purpose of this survey was to attempt to measure how men view existing gender norms,patriarchal social systems, gender disparities, and general roles of masculinity in the society.

#Use read.csv from the utils package (which is installed by default) to read in the data and assign it to a dataframe object to be used later.

#rename some columns using dplyr to make the df more readable

```{r, echo = TRUE}

We have data about `r nrow(masculinity_survey)` survey responses and `r ncol(masculinity_survey)` columns.
